## Simple Questions

**Can i get Vac Ban or is a Cheat?**
- No, this bot is used with **Steam Modules**, it's the same as **Steam App** for your Windows, the difference is that Simulate the games.

**Is this Bot saving Information about my Account?**
- No, You only enter your **Username** as **Password** into the Console Prompt, this details are secure, and nobody can get them.
- You can choose where to save, in **config.json** file and fill your details, or use the **prompt** to put them everyday. (for me is better prompt)

**Have the Creator or the Community Access?**
- No, this Bot is running in your **Localhost** (your pc).



## Let's Beggin

Install the NodeJs from https://nodejs.org/en/
Open your **CMD Prompt**

Use **npm** to install the necessary  modules:

npm install steam-user

npm install steamcommunity

npm install fs

npm install readline-sync

npm install request

npm install chalk

## Let's Start the bot
Note: the **config.json** file was changed, now you don't need to enter your username or password. Only on the CMD.. Easy way to move or save files.

- Go to **config.json** and change the **username** and the **passowrd**, then you need to enter the game Codes from http://steamcommunity.com/app/730 -> **730** ==  CS:GO

Use **node appBot.js** to start your bot

Note: You can only idle 25 games per Account/Bot. Idling more than 25 Games will automaticly Bug your Steam Game Hours.
